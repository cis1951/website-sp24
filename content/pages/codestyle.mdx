Please stick to this style when writing code for this class; it's also recommended to follow these same guidelines outside the classroom! TLDR, always write clean, readable code.

Make it readable plz :sob:

Also reference the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) or [this guide](https://google.github.io/swift/) for more information.

## **Naming Conventions**

### Syntax

- Classes & Interfaces &rarr; UpperCamelCase. e.g. `SchoolSchedule`
- Methods (functions) &rarr; lowerCamelCase. e.g. `dropClass()`
- Variables &rarr; lowerCamelCase. e.g. `let studentName = "Anthony"` or `var studentName = "Anthony"`

### Semantics

- Variable names &rarr; should be a good representative of their use. Never use one-letter names (except for loop counters).

  ```swift
  // BAD
  let x = 5
  classMember.examScore = x

  // GOOD
  let score = 5
  classMember.examScore = score
  ```

### Readability

- Line Length &rarr; lines are at most **100** characters long (Xcode should take care of the formatting for you for the most part).
- Vertical Spacing &rarr; add a **blank line** between methods for clarity.
- Modifiers &rarr; include modifiers on seperate lines like below:

  ```swift
  struct ContentView: View {
      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              Text("Hello, world!")
                  .padding()  // its own line
                  .background(Color.red)  // its own line
              Button(action: {
                  print("Button tapped")
              }) {
                  Text("Tap me!")
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Comments

Add clear comments **when needed** and **when necessary**.
- If code can be understood in a glance, don't add a comment.
- If code is complex, add a comment explaining what it does.

### Curly Braces & If Statements

- All curly braces start on the same line as preceding code.
- `else` statements start on the same line as preceding curly brace.
- No parentheses around `if` or `else` conditions.

    ```swift
    // BAD
    func delete()
    {
        if (isDeleted)
        {
            // ...
        }
        else
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

    // GOOD
    func delete() {
        if isDeleted {
            // ...
        } else {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```

### Semicolons

- **Just don't use them.** It will work if you have them, but there's no need. Please don't use them.

### `let` vs. `var`

- Only use `var` if you know the variable will change.
- Rule of thumb: declare everything as `let`, switch to `var` if you needed to change it later.

### Nullable Types

- It is preferred to declare variables and funciton return types as nullable `?` where a `null` value can take place.
- Use `!` as a last resort _if and only if_ you are 100% sure the variable will be defined beforehand.
