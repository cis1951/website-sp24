      This project-oriented course focuses on application development for current iOS mobile
      platforms using SwiftUI. In the initial stages, students will explore the fundamentals of
      mobile app development, including iOS and Xcode basics, Swift programming, and SwiftUI
      interface building. The curriculum progresses through advanced concepts like state management,
      app lifecycle, sensor integration, networking, and data persistence. In the latter part of the
      course, students work in teams to conceptualize and develop a significant mobile application.
      Creativity and originality are highly encouraged!
