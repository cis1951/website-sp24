## Introduction

In this assignment, you'll be building a location-based scavenger hunt game centered around the food and beverage institution we all know and love: Penn Dining.

You'll use the Core Location framework to detect when the user is near a dining hall. Then, you'll use either the Core Motion framework or SwiftUI's gesture support to allow the user to "collect" a dining hall by shaking their device or scribbling on the screen.

## Requirements

Your game should have two screens:
* A *home screen*, showing a list of dining halls and whether they've been "collected"
    * Tapping on a dining hall should take the user to the dining hall screen for the corresponding hall
* A *dining hall screen* that allows a user to "collect" a dining hall

Specifically, the dining hall screen should:
1. Check if the dining hall has already been collected. If it has, it should display a message saying so and prevent the user from collecting it again.
2. Check if the user is within **50 meters** of the dining hall. If they are not, it should display an error and prevent the user from collecting the dining hall.
3. Allow the user to collect the dining hall through one of two methods:
    * **Shaking the device:** Use the Core Motion framework to collect the dining hall the user shakes the device
        * You *must* use Core Motion to detect the shake with accelerometer data. Using `UIWindow.motionEnded()` will lead to reduced credit.
        * The algorithm doesn't need to be *perfect* (there can be some false positives) - just make sure ordinary motion won't trigger the collection.
    * **Drawing a scribble:** Use SwiftUI's gesture support to collect the dining hall when the user scribbles on the screen back and forth

We recommend going with the shaking method as it's more fun, but you should choose the scribble method if you can't test on a physical device (e.g. you don't have a Mac or an iPhone). **Do *not* implement both methods - you will only receive credit for one.**

You should keep track of the list of collected dining halls in a **view model** that is shared by both screens. Each dining hall should be represented by a **model struct**.

Your game should contain the following dining halls:
* 1920 Commons
* Accenture Café
* Falk Kosher Dining
* Hill House
* Houston Market
* Joe's Café
* Kings Court English House
* Lauder College House
* McClelland Express
* Pret A Manger
* Quaker Kitchen

Coordinates for these can be found in [the GPX files](https://github.com/cis1951/hw3-gpx), or you can [use Google Maps to find them](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539).

Finally, **please submit a short, 5-second video** of a dining hall being collected along with your project. This will help us grade, just in case we're not sure how to trigger the collection event.

**Note:** You are *not* required to store the user's progress between app launches. We will also not prescribe a specific way you should handle errors.

## Simulating Location

If you don't have access to a physical device or don't feel like making the trek to each of the dining halls, worry not! Xcode has a built-in location simulation feature that allows you to simulate your device's location using a GPX file. To use it:

1. [Download the GPX files from the link above.](https://github.com/cis1951/hw3-gpx)
2. Run your app in the simulator on a device.
3. In Xcode's menu bar, go to **Debug > Simulate Location > Add GPX File to Project...** and select the GPX files for each of the dining halls. (You can shift-click to select multiple files at once.)
4. Once you've added the GPX files, you can select them from the **Simulate Location** menu to simulate your device's location.

Note that if you're running on a physical device, location simulation will only work while your app is actively being run from Xcode. Running your app from the home screen will use the device's actual location.

(You can also use the **Features > Location** menu in the Simulator, but doing it through Xcode will let you use our GPX files.)

## Instructions

Some brief instructions to get you started:

1. Start by planning out how you're going to structure your app and its screens.
2. Create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode.
3. Model each dining hall using a struct. You can use [CLLocationCoordinate2D](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationcoordinate2d?language=swift) to represent the location of each dining hall.
4. Create a view model to keep track of which dining halls have been collected.
5. Write a view for the home screen, using the view model and models you wrote in steps 3 and 4.
6. Begin writing the view for the dining hall screen. This is a pretty complicated screen, so we recommend you split out the dirty logic into a separate view model.
7. Set up your `CLLocationManager` and its delegate, then request location permissions from the user.
    * Be sure to set up your **purpose string**!
8. Implement the logic to check if the user is within 50 meters of a dining hall.
9. Implement the logic to collect a dining hall using either the Core Motion framework or SwiftUI's gesture support.
    * For the motion case, you'll need to set up a `CMMotionManager` object, listen for device motion updates, then use the accelerometer data to detect a shake.
    * For gestures, you'll need to set up a gesture on your view, then use the position data you get from the `onChanged` handler to determine whether the user is scribbling. You may want to add a few state variables to help you with this.

Test your app using the location simulation steps above! As always, ask on Ed or in office hours if you have any questions or are running into trouble.

## Grading

This assignment is worth 100 points, broken down as follows:

### Home and Dining Hall Screens (15 points)
* 5 points: Home screen displays a list of dining halls
* 5 points: Home screen displays whether each dining hall has been collected
* 5 points: Tapping on a dining hall takes the user to the dining hall screen for that hall
* 5 points: Dining hall screen checks if the dining hall has already been collected

### Location (25 points)
* 5 points: App sets up a `CLLocationManager` and its delegate
* 5 points: App requests location permissions
* 15 points: Dining hall screen checks if the user is within 50 meters of the dining hall

### Collection (25 points)

If you're using Core Motion:
* 5 points: App sets up a `CMMotionManager` object and listens for device motion updates
* 20 points: Dining hall screen allows the user to collect the dining hall by shaking the device

If you're using SwiftUI gestures:
* 5 points: Dining hall screen sets up a gesture on the view
* 20 points: Dining hall screen allows the user to collect the dining hall by drawing a scribble

### App Architecture (20 points)
* 5 points: App uses a model struct to represent each dining hall
* 10 points: App uses a view model to keep track of which dining halls have been collected
* 5 points: App successfully uses `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and/or `@EnvironmentObject` to share the view model between the home and dining hall screens

### Video (5 points)
* 5 points: A short video is submitted showing a dining hall being collected

### Code Quality (10 points)
* 10 points: Code is readable (i.e. indentation and naming of symbols is reasonable)

### Deductions
* -20 points: App doesn't compile
* -10 points: App crashes or fails to launch during normal execution
* -10 points: Gesture/motion detection is unreliable (e.g. egregious false positives or negatives)

## Extra Credits

* **Map (+10):** Instead of a list, display the dining halls on a map. The user should be able to tap on a dining hall to go to the dining hall screen. The map should also show the user's current location.
* **Permission Priming (+10):** Before requesting location permissions, use the `.sheet` modifier to display a message explaining why the app needs the user's location.
    * Setting a purpose string is insufficient for this extra credit - you must display a separate message to the user.

## Submission

To submit, upload a zip (or .tar.gz) of your **entire Xcode project, including GPX files (if any) and video** to Canvas. Make sure you've given the requirements another read before you do so.
